Chemistry is an issue of energy and distribution of energy, which laws are discribed by thermodynamics.\\

Metabolism : deal with energy in the cell. In the metabolism, we find :
\begin{itemize}
    \item catabolism : decomposing complew molecules
    \item anabolism : biosynthesis of molecules to store energy from the catabolism.
\end{itemize}

Metabolism is also :
\begin{itemize}
    \item exoenergetic
    \item endoenergetic
\end{itemize}
Both are required.\\

It is a law of the Universe that everything evolves toward a maximisation of the spread of energy.\\

\textbf{Second law of thermodynamics :} The total entropy of a system and its surroundings always increases for a spontaneous process.\\
The distribution of thermal energy in a system is characterized by the number of quantized microstats that are accessible; the more of these there are, the greater the entropy of the system.\\
\[ S = k \ln \Omega \]
 $k$ Boltzmann constant, $\Omega$ the number of microstates (corresponding to given macrostate).
